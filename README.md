# Project 1: Quick Response Codes

## By Will Engdahl & Matthew Spofford

The project can be compiled using `make` or `make all`. There are also other Makefile rules for debugging purposes that can be found in `Makefile`.

To run the project, the `server.out` and `client.out` executables can be located in the `bin` directory that is created during the compilation process. The necessary .JAR files are also copied into the `bin` directory for convenience in running the server. For testing purposes, please use the QR code images provided in the `qr-codes` directory.
